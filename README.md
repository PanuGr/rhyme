# Rhyme

In this project, I've made a web application, which uses fetch-requests to a word database, provided by datamuse.org in order to help you find words that rhyme so you can write easier poems or songs.

## Version 2
This version focuses on refactoring the codebase to meet the new standards. The functionality remains the same.
Updates include:
- html improvements
- js improvements
- bug fixes
- functional improvements

## Version 3
This version integrates AI into this application. The AI is providing creative assistance:
- Line Suggestions: Get AI-powered suggestions for your next lines
- Poem Completion: Have AI complete your poem based on what you've written
- Structure Analysis: Get feedback on rhythm, imagery, and coherence
- Theme Discovery: Find related themes and topics for your poem
- Two-Panel Interface: Separated word finding from composition for better workflow

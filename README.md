# Rhyme

In this project, I've made a web application, which uses fetch-requests to a word database, provided by datamuse.org in order to help you find words that rhyme so you can write easier poems or songs. There's also AI-assistance with a model from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)

## Version 2
This version focuses on refactoring the codebase to meet the new standards. The functionality remains the same.
Updates include:
- html improvements
- js improvements
- bug fixes
- functional improvements

## Version 3
This version integrates AI into this application. The AI is providing creative assistance:
- Poem Completion: Have AI complete your poem based on what you've written
- Structure Analysis: Get feedback on rhythm, imagery, and coherence
- Two-Panel Interface: Separated word finding from composition for better workflow

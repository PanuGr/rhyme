# writepoem

In this project, I've made a web application, which uses fetch-requests to a word database, provided by datamuse.org in order to help you find words that rhyme so you can write easier poems or songs.

I've been using cypress.io for writing my TDD testing. There are 2 ways to run the test locally:

1. 
- Download the cypress application from their [website](https://www.cypress.io/)
- Run the cyrpess.exe file and drop my test.js file into the application

2. 
- type in your terminal `npm install`. 
- When cypress finishes downloading and installing, type `npm run cypress:open`
